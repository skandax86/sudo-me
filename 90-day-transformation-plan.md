**A. Front-End (UI/UX)**

- **Technology:** React, Vue, or Svelte (Specify rationale for choice, e.g., lightweight, performance).
- **Design:** Modular component-based (e.g., dedicated components for `FinanceTracker`, `HabitTracker`, `WorkoutLog`, etc.). Clean, intuitive, and mobile-responsive UI (Aesthetic based on 'Discipline/Clarity').
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify (Static Hosting).

**B. Back-End (API & Logic)**

- **Paradigm:** Serverless Functions (e.g., **Google Cloud Functions** or **Firebase Functions**).
- **Purpose:** Handle authentication, process complex calculations (e.g., financial projections, fitness metrics), and manage data flow between the UI and Database.
- **Modularity Requirement:** Functions must be compartmentalized by use-case (e.g., `FinanceService`, `HabitService`, `CareerService`).

**C. Database & Data Store**

- **Technology:** **Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)** or **Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL Free Tier)** (Specify rationale for choice: scalability, ease of use, cost).
- **Structure:** Define the core Collections/Tables:
    - `Users` (Profile, Targets).
    - `DailyLogs` (Habit tracking, LeetCode count, Water intake).
    - `FinancialTransactions` (Expense tracking, Budget categories).
    - `Workouts` (Gym logs, Running metrics).
    - `Goals` (90-Day Milestones, Long-term targets).
- **Backup Strategy:** Automated daily backups (e.g., using a Cloud Function to export data to Cloud Storage).

**D. Core Tooling & Integration**

- **LLM Integration (LLM Model):** Used for **Personalized Advice/Coaching** and **Data Interpretation**.
    - **Use Case 1 (Coach):** Daily reflection summarization, providing insights from journal entries/metrics.
    - **Use Case 2 (Plan Generation):** Customizing workout/diet plans based on user input, leveraging the 90-day plan blueprint.
- **Multi-Cloud Provider (MCP) Integration:** Not required for V1.0, but architecture must be agnostic (e.g., using standard RESTful APIs) to allow for easy swap of services (e.g., switching from Firebase to AWS Lambda/DynamoDB later).
- **BAML Tool Integration:** Define a simple data validation/parsing layer (e.g., in the serverless functions) to ensure all incoming data (e.g., expense entries, workout logs) adheres to strict schemas before database insertion.

### III. Core Modules (Use Cases)

1. **Finance Module:** Budget vs. Actual tracking, Investment portfolio tracking (SIP, ETFs, Stocks), Emergency Fund progress, $₹5$L asset goal visualization.
2. **Habit & Goal Tracking:** Daily check-ins (6 AM wake, Cold Shower, Meditation), LeetCode/Study hours, Discipline/Impulse Control tracking (Y/N).
3. **Workout & Fitness Log:** Logging 4x Gym, 2x Calisthenics/Running, Swimming lesson progress. Tracking water intake (1 Gallon).
4. **Grooming & Posture Routine:** Daily checks (Y/N), logging skin/hair care compliance.
5. **Career & Learning Tracker:** Certification timeline progress, DSA problem count, Job Application status.

### IV. Deployment & Scalability

- **V1.0 Goal:** Fully functional Web Application (MPV).
- **Android Scalability:** The modular design must use a framework/tool that allows for future reuse (e.g., React Native/Flutter for the front-end, or maintaining a clean separation between API/DB and UI).
- **Cost Control:** Strict use of free-tier or minimal-cost services for all components.

## VI. Security and Maintainability

1. **Security Rules:** Implement strict Firebase Security Rules to ensure users can only read/write their own data (User UID pathing).
2. **Code Quality:** Utilize TypeScript strictly across the entire project. Enforce TSLint/ESLint rules for code consistency.
3. **Deployment:** Implement CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Vercel/Firebase Tools) for automated deployment on code commit."

This is the **Master Prompt**. It is designed to act as a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** and **Technical Design Document (TDD)** combined.

You can copy and paste this entire block into a powerful LLM (like GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced) to generate the exact code structure, file trees, and logic needed by a development team.

# Master Technical Specification: The 90-Day PDS Engine

Role: Act as a Senior Principal Full-Stack Engineer and System Architect.

Project: Build a production-ready, modular, and scalable Personal Development System (PDS).

Context: This application is the digital enforcement mechanism for a high-intensity 90-day self-improvement protocol. It must be built on a strict Free-Tier/Serverless architecture but designed for future scaling to mobile.

---

## 1. Technology Stack & Architecture

**Constraint:** Use the "T3 Stack" philosophy but adapted for Firebase to ensure zero initial cost.

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router, Server Components).
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI (Components) + Lucide React (Icons).
- **State Management:**
    - *Server State:* TanStack Query (v5).
    - *Global Client State:* Zustand (for UI toggles like "Monk Mode").
- **Backend & Auth:** Firebase v9 (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions).
- **Validation:** Zod (Schema-first design).
- **AI Engine:** Vercel AI SDK (integrating with OpenAI or Gemini API for coaching).
- **Date Handling:** date-fns.

---

## 2. Core Business Logic (The 90-Day Rules Engine)

The application must enforce the following logic strictly. Hardcode these parameters into a `config/constants.ts` file.

### A. The Three Phases (Time-Gating)

The app UI must change context based on the current day relative to the user's `startDate`.

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1–30):** Focus on boolean habit completion.
2. **Phase 2: Intensity (Days 31–60):** Unlocks advanced fitness metrics and secondary cloud certification tracking.
3. **Phase 3: Mastery (Days 61–90):** Unlocks the "Job Switch" dashboard and "Asset Optimization" views.

### B. The Daily "Morning Protocol" (Scoring Algorithm)

Every day, the user logs a "Morning Report." The system calculates a `disciplineScore` (0-100%) based on these weighted inputs:

- `wakeUpTime` (Target: ≤ 06:00 AM) [Critical Weight].
- `noPhoneFirstHour` (Boolean) [High Weight].
- `coldShower` (Boolean).
- `meditation` (Boolean, Min 10 mins).
- `planTomorrowDone` (Boolean - checked from previous night).

### C. Financial logic (The 30/10/20/20 Rule)

Implement a strict budget validator.

- **Hard Limits (Monthly):**
    - `Essentials`: Max ₹30,000 (Trigger UI Warning if > 90%).
    - `Wants`: Max ₹10,000.
- **Investment Distributor (Auto-Calculation):**
    - User inputs `investmentAmount` (Target ₹20,000).
    - System allocates: 30% Low Risk (Liquid Fund), 40% Mid Risk (ETF/Gold), 30% High Risk (Stocks).
- **Asset Tracker:** Visualize progress toward the **₹5L Asset Goal**.

### D. Career & Learning Engine

- **LeetCode:** Progress bar `current / 300`.
- **Certifications:** Two-stage toggle:
    1. AWS Cloud (Deadline: Day 60).
    2. Databricks (Deadline: Day 90).
- **Deep Work:** A Pomodoro timer specifically for "Learning Block 1" (06:40–07:30) and "Learning Block 2" (20:00–22:00).

### E. Fitness Logic (The 4+2 Split)

- **Weekly Validator:** Must detect 4 Gym sessions + 2 Cardio/Calisthenics sessions per week.
- **Water Tracker:** Counter logic 0/128 oz (1 Gallon).
- **Calisthenics Milestone:** Track specific progress on "L-Sit" and "Pull-up" counts.

---

## 3. Database Schema (Firestore)

Use strict typing with Zod schemas mirrored to Firestore collections.

### Collection: `users`

- `uid`: string (Primary Key)
- `profile`: { `startDate`: Timestamp, `targetWeight`: number, `salary`: number }
- `gamification`: { `currentStreak`: number, `totalXp`: number, `level`: string }

### Collection: `daily_logs` (Sub-collection of `users`)

- `date`: string (ISO YYYY-MM-DD)
- habits: {
    
    wokeUpAt6am: boolean,
    
    coldShower: boolean,
    
    noPhoneFirstHour: boolean,
    
    meditated: boolean,
    
    plannedTomorrow: boolean
    
    }
    
- fitness: {
    
    workoutType: 'Gym' | 'Run' | 'Calisthenics' | 'Swim' | 'Rest',
    
    waterIntakeOz: number,
    
    sleepHours: number
    
    }
    
- learning: {
    
    leetCodeSolved: number,
    
    pagesRead: number,
    
    studyHours: number
    
    }
    
- journal: {
    
    impulseControlRating: 1-5,
    
    notes: string (Sent to LLM)
    
    }
    

### Collection: `transactions` (Sub-collection of `users`)

- `amount`: number
- `category`: 'Essentials' | 'Wants' | 'Investments' | 'Savings' | 'Goals'
- `description`: string
- `timestamp`: Timestamp

---

## 4. API & Cloud Functions (Serverless)

Define the following generic triggers:

1. **`onDailyLogCreate`**:
    - Trigger: New document in `daily_logs`.
    - Action 1: Update `users/{uid}/gamification.currentStreak`.
    - Action 2: Send `journal.notes` + `habits` to OpenAI/Gemini.
    - Output: Write a summarized "Coach Tip" to `users/{uid}/notifications`.
2. **`checkBudgetHealth`**:
    - Trigger: New document in `transactions`.
    - Action: Sum `amount` for current month where `category == 'Essentials'`.
    - Logic: If sum > ₹30,000, write a "Breach Alert" to Firestore.
3. **`weeklyReviewJob`**:
    - Trigger: Scheduled (Every Sunday 23:59).
    - Action: Aggregate last 7 days of logs.
    - Logic: Verify "4x Gym" and "15 LeetCode" targets. Generates a "Weekly Scorecard" document.

---

## 5. UI/UX Specifications

1. **Monk Mode Switch:** A global toggle in the navbar. When active, hides all charts, net worth numbers, and social features. Only shows the **Daily Checklist** and **Deep Work Timer**.
2. **The Dashboard:**
    - **Hero Section:** "Day X of 90" (Progress Bar).
    - **Quad Grid:**
        - Block 1: Discipline Score (Today).
        - Block 2: LeetCode Count (Total).
        - Block 3: Portfolio Value (vs ₹5L target).
        - Block 4: Body Weight (Line Chart).
3. **Quick Log Modal:** A unified modal to input habits, workout, and spending in under 60 seconds.

---

## 6. Required Output (Deliverables)

Based on the extensive specification above, please generate:

1. **File Structure Tree:** A complete directory structure for the Next.js project including `components`, `lib`, `hooks`, and `types`.
2. **Zod Schemas (`lib/validations.ts`):** The exact Zod code to validate the User Profile, Daily Log, and Transaction inputs based on the limits defined (e.g., max ₹30k).
3. **Custom Hook (`hooks/useDisciplineScore.ts`):** The logic to calculate the 0-100% daily score based on the weighted inputs.
4. **Firestore Security Rules:** The code to ensure data privacy (users can only read/write their own data).
5. **Mermaid.js Diagram:**
